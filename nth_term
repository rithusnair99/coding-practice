/*Given the first 2 terms A1 and A2 of an Arithmetic Series.Find the Nth term of the series. 
Example 1:

Input:
A1=2
A2=3
N=4
Output:
5
Explanation:
The series is 2,3,4,5,6....
Thus,4th term is 5.


soln:

n=int(input())
first=int(input())
second=int(input())
difference=second-first
t=first+(n-1)*difference
print(n,"th term is",t)
